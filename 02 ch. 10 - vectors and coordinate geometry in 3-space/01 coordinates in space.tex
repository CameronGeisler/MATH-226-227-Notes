A vector in space has 3 components. There are three mutually perpendicular axes. Consider a point $P$ in space. Its coordinates are obtained by dropping perpendicular lines to the axes, analogously to the plane.

\begin{definition}
In 3-space, the \textbf{coordinate planes} are the planes spanned by the axes, the $xy$-plane, $xz$-plane, and the $yz$-plane.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
An \textbf{octant} is one of the eight regions in which 3-space is divided up by coordinate planes. The \textbf{first octant} is the octant where $x \geq 0$, $y \geq 0$, and $z \geq 0$.
\end{definition}
